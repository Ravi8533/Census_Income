cencus income project
<br>
This project aims to analyse the Census Income dataset obtained from the UCI Machine 
Learning Repository. The dataset contains income information for over 48,000 individuals 
based on the 1994 US census. The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive 
models to determine whether an individual makes over 50,000 a year or less based on 
demographic and socioeconomic attributes.
